#### Description

#### Improvements
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input validation: </strong>The website does not allow the user to withdraw money higher than the actual account balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Better UI: </strong>Buttons for Deposit and Cash Back changed to a select tag with those options.</li>
</ul>
